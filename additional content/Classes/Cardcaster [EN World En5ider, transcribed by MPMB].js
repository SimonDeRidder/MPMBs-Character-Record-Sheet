/*  -INFORMATION-
	Subject:    Class
	Effect:     This script adds the class called "Cardcaster" with its 5 subclasses and its unique spellcasting system
				The subclasses include "Knight of Swords", "Page of Wands", and "Queen of Cups" from EN5ider 106
				And also include "King of Pentacles" and "Jack of Beasts" from EN5ider 110

				This class has been made by EN World EN5ider

				This class can be found here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/6947104

				Please support the creators of this content on their Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ensider

	Code by:	MorePurpleMoreBetter
	Date:		2018-08-13 (sheet v13.0.0beta4)

	As no multiclassing rules are given in the source, the ones here are an interpretation by MPMB.

	Note that because the spells available to this class very so much during play, the character sheet will generate a spell sheet with all possible spells available through the cards. This way the spell sheet is a reference during play and not a list of available spells at any one time.
