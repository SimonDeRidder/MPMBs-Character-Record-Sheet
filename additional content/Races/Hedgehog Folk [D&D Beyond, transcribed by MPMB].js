/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Race
	Effect:		This script adds a player race, called "Hedgehog Folk"
				This is taken from the homebrew section on D&D Beyond (https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/races/9921-hedgehog-folk)
				This race is made by Gerryv753
	Code by:	MorePurpleMoreBetter
	Date:		2018-11-21 (sheet v13.0.0beta6)

	Caution:	MorePurpleMoreBetter advises against using this race as it breaks game balance (advantage on initiative and ability checks is overpowered even if conditional).
				This code was made on commission for a patron.
