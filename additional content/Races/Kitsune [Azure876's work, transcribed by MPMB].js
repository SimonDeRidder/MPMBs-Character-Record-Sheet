/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Race
	Effect:		This script adds the race "Kitsune" and its 3 subraces
				This is taken from the GM Binder website (https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L6XpvoJ9qPmjAiho52X)
				These subraces have been made by Azure876
	Code by:	MorePurpleMoreBetter
	Date:		2019-07-29 (sheet v13.0.0beta18)

	Caution:	MorePurpleMoreBetter advises against using this race as it breaks game balance (some of its features are clearly overpowered). This code was made on commission for a patron.
